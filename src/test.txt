How're you now?
We don’t fight at wedding’s. Jinx, you owe me a coke. Figure it out. Your friend had a clean win scrap with a skid the other day but put on Chapstick right after, so kinda a draw really. You guys do CrossFit? Go Time! Deaad, hey Deaad! Better not forget those all dressed chips. You know, not to be impolite… I guess we gots to calls up the internet. It’s impolite to kiss and tell. Not so bad. Boots and the Ginger. Grandpa always said a beer and a dart go together like a piss and a fart. Oh…. that is noisy Dan. Your friends dog bit you the other day then ran off, so it’s still out there somewhere.

Oh, that’s near Doctor Assisted Dan. Figure it out. You have a Dad, but half your friends have a Deaad… for some reason. We don’t fight at wedding’s. Some goof uptown with ankle socks and a pony tail thought you were serious when you asked him if he was hitting the links. You pee outside as much as the dog does. Cousin says his sled has so much torque he can’t keep the front end down, kay Bud, you wanna blow smoke we’ll have a dart. Let’s go easy over there, Squirrel Dan. Your friends dog bit you the other day then ran off, so it’s still out there somewhere. Go Time! Toughest guy in Letterkenny. Not so bad. Drove the ride on mower drunk and now you got a corn maze. Well here’s a tip, don’t fart in a space suit. Is that what you appreciate about me?
